# Hi-Hat-Processor-Script
Script for Logic Pro X's Scripter midi effect. Automates alternation in hi-hat velocity and delay. 

Add the .pst file to your Scripter folder to use this script with Logic Pro's Scripter midi effect plugin. Allows for convenient adjustments to midi hi-hats: 
every other hi-hat's velocity and sample delay can be controlled with a slider to quickly add swing and bounce to hi-hat patterns.
